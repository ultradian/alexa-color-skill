# alexa-color-skill
basic skill for teaching Python SDK coding for Alexa

[learnAlexa.ipynb](learnAlexa.ipynb) is a Python3 Jupyter notebook that contains a step-by-step tutorial on how to make a Custom Alexa skill using the Alexa Developer account and AWS Lambda.  I created it for a workshop I gave at the [Santa Cruz Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Santa-Cruz-Python/events/kmkhxqyzlblc/) on Aug 28, 2019
